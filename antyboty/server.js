**🛡️ Step-by-Step Malware Removal Guide**  
*User:*  
"I’m using Windows."

**CyberBot’s Response:**  
🔹 Provides immediate guidance while ensuring clarity.

"Thank you for the information. Here are the steps to remove malware from your Windows device safely:

- **Step 1: Disconnect from the Internet**  
  To prevent the malware from spreading or communicating with external sources, disconnect your device from Wi-Fi or unplug the Ethernet cable.

- **Step 2: Boot into Safe Mode**  
  Restart your computer and press F8 (or Shift + Restart) to enter Safe Mode. This limits background programs, preventing malware from running.

- **Step 3: Run a Full Antivirus Scan**  
  Use a trusted security software like Windows Defender or Malwarebytes. Let the scan complete and follow the removal instructions.

- **Step 4: Uninstall Suspicious Programs**  
  Go to Control Panel → Programs & Features → Look for unfamiliar programs installed recently. Uninstall anything suspicious.

- **Step 5: Clear Temporary Files**  
  Run Disk Cleanup (search for it in the Windows menu) to remove temporary files that malware might use.

- **Step 6: Update Your System and Security Software**  
  Ensure Windows and your security software are up to date to protect against future threats.

- **Step 7: Monitor for Unusual Activity**  
  If your system still behaves strangely, consider restoring your device to a previous state or contacting an expert for further assistance.

Would you like me to generate a detailed PDF report with these steps for future reference?

**🔄 Alternative Approach (For Users Uncertain About the Threat)**

*User:*  
"I’m not sure if my system is infected, but it’s acting strangely."

**CyberBot’s Response:**  
🔹 Guides user to identify potential threats.

"Let’s check for common signs of malware. Please review the following symptoms and let me know if any apply to your device:

- ✅ Unexpected pop-ups or warnings  
- ✅ Slow system performance without reason  
- ✅ Programs opening or closing on their own  
- ✅ Unusual network activity or unknown processes running  
- ✅ Suspicious emails or unauthorized logins

If any of these apply to you, I recommend running a full system scan. Would you like guidance on how to do this based on your device type?"

**🌍 Multi-Device Support**  
🔹 CyberBot tailors its response based on the device type (Windows, Mac, Mobile). Each flow ensures clear, effective guidance without overwhelming the user.
